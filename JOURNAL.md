# Real Life Redstone
This is my journal documenting my process of making real life redstone
I already started a little bit on this but I only have the repeater mostly complete.

A while back I was brainstorming ideas on how to connect the pieces and I think using pogo pins on each component face would work well.

# May 17, 2025: Repeater simulation done?
I got a working simulation in falstad (minus the LEDs) so I think everything will work out. <br>
Sorry I didn't document this process because I already started. It was a combonation of asking ChatGPT how do I do X and google
- How do i make a voltage subtractor?
- How can I make a circuit so it waits 50ms after a rising or falling edge, then outputs

This is the current Falstad file that should have everthing except LEDs (including repeater locking). [File here](https://github.com/BoomBoomMushroom/MinecraftRedstoneInRealLife/blob/main/falstad_files/repeater_working.txt)

# May 19, 2025: Wiring
I finished transfering the falstad schematic into a kicad schematic
I am now wiring the pcb in kicad. I am having a hard time trying to make it small, while using all the room, but also not trying to make it massive.
I have worked on the pcb routing for about 2 hours today.
